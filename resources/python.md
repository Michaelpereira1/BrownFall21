## Key Resources


- [Course Text](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) this book roughly covers things that we cover in the course, but since things change quickly, we don't rely on it too closely
- [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) this site includes high quality tutorials
- [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/) this blog has some good tutorials, but old ones are not always updated, so always check the date and don't rely too much on posts more than 2 years old.
