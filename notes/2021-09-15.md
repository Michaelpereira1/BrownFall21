# Pandas DataFrames



Today, we're going to explore Data Frames in greater detail. We'll continue using
that same coffee dataset.

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_data_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database/master/data/robusta_data_cleaned.csv'
```
## More about loading libraries
We can import pandas without the alias `pd` if we want, but then we have to use
the full name everywhere
```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pandas.read_csv()
```

We'll use `pd` because that's the more common convention and so that we can type
fewer characters throughout our code
```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
```

## Examining DataFrames

```{code-cell} ipython3
df = pd.read_csv(coffee_data_url,index_col=0)
```

We can look at the first 5 rows with `head`
```{code-cell} ipython3
df.head()
```

Using help, we can see tha that head takes one parameter and has a default value
of 5, which is why we got 5 rows, but we can get 2 instead

```{code-cell} ipython3
df.head(2)
```

We can look at the last rows with `tail`
```{code-cell} ipython3
df.tail(3)
```


I told you this was a DataFrame, but we can check with type.
```{code-cell} ipython3
type(df)
```

We can also exmaine its parts.  It consists of several; first the column headings

```{code-cell} ipython3
df.columns
```

These are a special type called Index
```{code-cell} ipython3
type(df.columns)
```

It also has an index
```{code-cell} ipython3
df.index
```

and values
```{code-cell} ipython3
df.values
```

it also knows its own shape
```{code-cell} ipython3
df.shape
```

we can use builtin fucntions on our DataFrame too not just its own methods and
attributes.
```{code-cell} ipython3
len(df)
```

Why does `len` turn green?
it's a python reserve word

## Building a Data Frame programmatically

One way to build a data frame is from a dictionary:
```{code-cell} ipython3
people = {'names':['Sarah','Connor','Kenza'],
         'username':['brownsarahm','sudoPsych','kbdlh']}
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
people
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(people)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
people_df = pd.DataFrame(people)
people_df
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(people['names'])
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(people)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

type({4,5,5})
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
{4,5,5}
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
people['names']
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(set(people['names']))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
unique_people = set(people['names'])
type(unique_people)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
df.columns
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
for col in df.columns:
    print(col.split('.'))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
for key,value in people.items():
    print(key,':',value)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
df['Owner']
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
df.Owner
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
df
```

Key points:

_write three things to remember from today's class_


## Questions After Classroom

_many overlapping questions today_

## General

```{dropdown} How to know which function to use in certain problems or situations

This is something you build up knowledge of slowly, and, sometimes you have a
general idea, but have to look up the specifics. Having domain expertise of the
dataset or a collaborator that does will help you
```


## Clarifying


```{dropdown} Is there a way to have a set show the duplicates that get discarded?
- no, `set` is casting the data type so it loses information
```



```{dropdown} being able to access the code somewhere without asking to scroll would be nice
- will work on adding most code to prismia, but if I miss some, always ask.
```



## Course Admin

```{dropdown} When will homeworks be posted/due typically?
- Posted Wednesday
- Due the followign Tuesday
```

## Questions we'll answer later


```{dropdown} can you use cast a pandas dataframe into a set?
- there are better ways to find unique values and remove duplicates in a dataframe

```

## Try it yourself


- Create variables of three different types with facts about yourself. Use descriptive variable names relative to the contents, not their types.

  ```{code-cell} ipython3
  :tags:["hide-input"]
  title = 'dr' #string
  office_number = 134 # int
  courses_taught = ['Programming for Data Science',
    'Machine Learning for Science & Society']
  ```
- Create a list, again with a descriptive name, and print out the types

  ```{code-cell} ipython3
  :tags:["hide-input"]

  about_prof_brown_list = [title, office_number, courses_taught]

  # regular for loop
  for fact in about_prof_brown_list:
      print (type(fact))
```
- Write a function, `type_extractor` that takes a list and a type and returns the item of that type from the list
- Test your function on all three items from your dictionary.
- Use one type of jupyter help on your function, what does it display? If it doesn't display anything modify your function so that help will work.
- Make yourself notes in the most memorable way for you about what a DataFrame is.
