# re-coding and inconsisten coding

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np #
na_toy_df = pd.DataFrame(data = [[1,3,4,5],[2 ,6, np.nan]])

# make plots look nicer and increase font size
sns.set_theme(font_scale=2)
arabica_data_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database/master/data/arabica_data_cleaned.csv'

coffee_df = pd.read_csv(arabica_data_url)


rhodyprog4ds_gh_events_url = 'https://api.github.com/orgs/rhodyprog4ds/events'
course_gh_df = pd.read_json(rhodyprog4ds_gh_events_url)
```

So far, we've dealt with structural issues in data. but there's a lot more to

cleaning.  



Today, we'll deal with how to fix the values wihtin the data. To see the

types of things:

Dealing with missing data is a whole research area. There isn't one solution.



in 2020 there was a workshop on it



There are also many classic approaches both when training and when applying models.



example application in breast cancer detection



Even in pandas, dealing with missing values is under experimentaion

 as to how to represent it symbolically



 Missing values even causes the datatypes to change

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.head()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Lot.Number'].dtype
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Lot.Number'].value_counts()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Lot.Number'].fillna(1)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Lot.Number']
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['lot_number_clean'] = coffee_df['Lot.Number'].fillna('1')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.head()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.dropna().shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.dropna(subset=['altitude_low_meters']).shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```
