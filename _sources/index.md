## Using this Site

The Syllabus section has logistical operations for the course broken down into sections.  You can also read straight through by starting in the first one and navigating to the next section using the arrow navigation at the end of the page.  

This site is a resource for the course.  We do not follow a text book for this course, but all notes from class are posted in the notes section, accessible on the left hand side menu, visible on large screens and in the menu on mobile.



The resources section has links and short posts for reference
