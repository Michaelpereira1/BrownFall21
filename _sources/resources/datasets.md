## Best for loading directly into a notebook

- [Json Datasets](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets)
- [National Center for Education Statistics Digest 2019](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d19/tables_3.asp) These data tables are available for download as excel and visible on the page.
- Lots of wikipedia pages have tables in them.


## Requires some more work

- [Stackoverflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) This data comes with readme info all packaged together in a .zip. You'll need to unzip it first.
- [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) most Kaggle datasets will require you to download and unzip them first and then you can copy them into your repo folder.
- [UCI Data Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
