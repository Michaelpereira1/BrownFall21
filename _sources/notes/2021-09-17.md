# More Loading Data, Indexing, and Iterables


As always, we'll start with loading pandas.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
```


## Checking in on help hours

_if you missed class, check over the office hours schedule and e-mail if you can or cannot attend at least one time_

## Portfolio Preparation and Maintainance

We'll spend a little time today getting your portfolio ready for the first check.
### Access your portfolio

Go to your portflio
- from the [course organization](https://github.com/rhodyprog4ds/)
- from the list of your recent repositories on the left hand side of the [GitHub home page](https://github.com/)

optionally, open it locally as well (we're going to update content and)

### Start your Know, Want to Know, Learned Table

In each portfolio submission introduction, you'll reflect on what you've learned.  To get ready for that, we'll first make note of what you already know and what you want to know.

````{margin}
This will render as a table in your built portflio, for reference on the syntax,
[refer to the Tables section of the jupyterbook Myst Markdown cheatsheet](https://jupyterbook.org/reference/cheatsheet.html#tables).
````

1. edit `submission_1_intro` in your portfolio locally or on GitHub:
1. In the KWL section in the first two bullets after each skill with what you know and want to know.  You can edit these in more detail later.

```{warning}
If you work on this in the GitHub website, be sure to pull these chances locally before you start working offline next
```

### Merge the setup work

Once you're done, Go to your pull request tab, and select the feedback Pull Reques. Commit any suggestions if you'd like and then merge the PR.
```{warning}
only do this after grading
```

```{note}
To view the feedback, after merging the PR, remove `is:open` from the search bar on the PR page
```

## Indexing


```{code-cell} ipython3
topics = ['what is data science', 'jupyter',
          'conditional','functions', 'lists',
          'dictionaries','pandas' ]
```

What will topics[-1] return?
```{code-cell} ipython3
topics[-1]
```


Using negative indices starts from the right. The last element is -1.  The first is 0.

## Reading DataFrames from Websites

We'll first read from the course website.

```{code-cell} ipython3
course_comms_url = 'https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall21/syllabus/communication.html'
```

So far, we've read data in from a .csv file with `pd.read_csv` and created a DataFrame with the constructor `pd.DataFrame` using a dictionary. Pandas provides many interfaces for reading in data.  They're described on the [Pandas IO page](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/io.html).

````{margin}
```{note}
Using the documentation for a library (and the base language) is
totally expected and normal part of programming.  That's what you
should use as your primary source for questions in this class.  Other
sources can become outdated pretty quickly as the language changes, but
most of the libraries we'll use have processes in place to ensure that
their own documentation gets updated at the same time the code does.
```

```{warning}
If you use other sources and get advised to solutions that are deprecated you may not earn achievements for that work.
```
````

We can use the `read_html` method to read from this page.  We know that it has multple tables on the page, so lets see what it t does:

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.read_html(course_comms_url)
```

It appears to have read all of them, lets check the type:

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(pd.read_html(course_comms_url))
```

Since we know it's a list, we'll save it to a variable that indicates that.

```{code-cell} ipython3
comms_list = pd.read_html(course_comms_url)
```

If we get just the first element,

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(comms_list[0])
```
it's a DataFrame and prints accordingly.

```{code-cell} ipython3
comms_list[0]
```

Since it's a list, we can use base python's `len` function to check how many tables there are
```{code-cell} ipython3
len(comms_list)
```

We've seen the first table and know it's the help hours, so we can save that to a separate variable and use it
```{code-cell} ipython3
help_df = comms_list[0]
```

We've inspected the dataframe some before, but we can also check the type of each column.

````{margin}
```{admonition} Further Reading
You can read more about the [details of data types](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/basics.html#basics-dtypes) in Pandas in the documentation
```
````


```{code-cell} ipython3

help_df.dtypes
```

## How are objects printed in jupyter?

````{admonition} Question from class
Q: Why does it have `dtype:object` after the type for each row?
A: the last line is information about the object that is being printed out.
````

````{margin}
```{note}
this section is added, it didn't happen this way in class.  This section, describes **how** I figured out the answer to the question about why that extra line is diplayed.
```
````

To understand this, let's save the thing we're curious to a variable so we can examine it multiple ways more easily.

```{code-cell} ipython3

help_df_types = help_df.dtypes
```

Next we'll check the type of this object and its shape

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(help_df_types)
```
a {term}`Series` is like a DataFrame, but just one row with headings, and then rotated.

```{code-cell} ipython3
help_df_types.shape
```

This means that it's length is 4 and it's a 1 dimensional object; the column headers have converted to an index and are treated as metadata, but  not a part of the actual data.

So, the line we're interested in is not a part of the object, because it's length 4 and the thing we're curious about is the fifth line.

We'll pick one variable from the DataFrame and check its type
```{code-cell} ipython3
type(help_df['Day'])
```

This is also a Series, so lets check its output
```{code-cell} ipython3
help_df['Day']
```
THe last line of this one is information about the Series, its name, and its dtype.

Let's make another series, and see how it prints

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.Series([5,4,5])
```

The last line is the dtype of the Series; so in our original object, that last line is because the list of dtypes is the of type object.

```{code-cell} ipython3
help_df_types
```

## How do we know what to check?


we examined the DataFrame so far by (me) knowing what to look for.  

In python objects
you can progrmamatically find what to look for with the `__dict__` attribute or
we can rely on the [online documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) or use it via help.

````{margin}
```{admonition} Everything is Data
:class: tip

writing good documentation lets people who use your code get help for free
Not only do help tools use the docs, but that website is generated programmatically
using a tool called Sphinx from the documentation inside the code.
You can access the docstring of a python using the `.__doc__` attribute
```
````

In ipython (what we use in jupyter, by default) we can use the `?` for help
````{margin}
```{caution}
[ipython help](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/python-ipython-diff.html?highlight=help#accessing-help) read about how it works, if it doesn't work for you to try to figure out why
```
````

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.DataFrame?
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["output_scroll"]
help(pd.DataFrame)
```

```{admonition} Try it yourself!
Make a list of the shape of all of the tables on the syllabus Achievements page.
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
achievements_url = 'https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall21/syllabus/achievements.html'
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["hide-input"]
shape_list_comp =  [df.shape for df in pd.read_html(achievements_url)]
shape_list_comp
```
This solution uses a list comprehension which allows us to compress a loop. It's equivalent to the following with a for loop

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["hide-input"]
shape_list_loop = []

for df in pd.read_html(achievements_url):
    shape_list_loop.append(df.shape)

shape_list_loop
```


````{margin}
```{admonition} Question from class
Python does have [ternary operators](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/ternary_operators.html) but the dictionary is a more common
way to achieve this and goal and more common patterns are better for
readability
```
````
(notes:lambda-dict)=
## Lambdas and Dictionaries for switching
What if we want to print out the first column  for the dataFrame if it has more than 3 columns and the whole thing if it has 3 or less columns?

````{margin}
```{admonition} Further Reading
You can refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.9/reference/expressions.html#lambda) on {term}`lambda` functions for a brief syntax description or this [tutorial on Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-lambda/) for more context, history, and examples.
```
```{important}
We'll see lambdas again and again. Starting with summarizing data and again when cleaning. Understanding how to use these will help.
```
````

Two ways of writing a function
```{code-cell} ipython3
# with the def key
def first_col_f(d):
    return d[d.columns[0]]

# lambda (anonymous function)
first_col_l = lambda d: d[d.columns[0]]

first_col_f(help_df) == first_col_l(help_df)
```

```{admonition} Try it yourself
read the code excerpt above carefully and try to match up the parts of a function: its name, the parameter list, and the body. Try writing your own lambda function.

Lambdas are an example of an {term}`anonymous function`
```

We can put functions in dictionaries, or even define a lambda right in the dictionary.  




```{code-cell} ipython3
df_display = {True: lambda d: d[d.columns[0]],
       False: lambda d: d}

for df in pd.read_html(achievements_url):
    _, n_cols = df.shape
    print(df_display[n_cols>3](df))
```

In that excerpt df_display has a key that is defined to be true or false.
The value for each item in the dictionary (separated by commas `,`) is a lambda
fucntion, both of which take a parameter `d`, and one of which returns the first
column `d[d[columns[0]]` and the other fow which returns the whole data frame `d`.


In thee loop,  we set index into the dictionary with the key `n_cols > 3` with
`df_display[n_cols>3]` sometimes it will be true and other times it will be false,
which matches the two keys defined in the dictionary.  Then the parameter it
 takes is `d`, which we pass the whole data frame `df` with the `(df)` at the
 end of the line.


```{admonition} Try it Yourself!
What does the `_` do?
```

```admonition} Try it Yourself!
Try using that dictionary outside of the loop.  What is the value for a give key
if you print it out like `df_display[ a_key_value]`? What if you use `True` or
`False` directly? what if you try a number? What is the type of that? What if you
pass something that's not a DataFrame as the parameter?  Make notes about these outputs
```

```

## More Practice

- What `type` is the shape of a `pandas.DataFrame`?
- use a list comprehension to create a list that you could use as column names for data that consists of `N` measurements. Set `N=5` for now, but you suspect that the number might change.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["hide-input"]
N = 4
meas_cols = ['meas' + str(i) for i in range(N)]
```
- create a list of items with different types, then Create a dictionary with the types as keys using a dictionary comprehension. Dictionary comprehensions are similar to list comprehensions, in their form.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["hide-input"]
about_prof_brown_list = ['Dr. ', 134, ['CSC310','CSC592','CSC392']]

about_prof_brown_dict = {type(fact):fact for fact in about_prof_brown_list}
```
- Create a `lambda` function to print return the first 2 rows of a data frame
