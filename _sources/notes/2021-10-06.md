# Reveiwing Merges & Databases

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.merge?
```

If `weather_df` has a row for every date in the past 100 years, a column named `date` and columns for the weather that day and `birthdays_df` has a row for each member of the CS department with a column `birthdate` and a second column name, how would you merge these two datasets to find out the weather on the day each person was born?



complete the following line:

```
bday_weather = pd.merge(left= weather_df, right = birthdays_df, 
                        left_on = 'date', right_on ='birthdate', how= 'inner')
```
