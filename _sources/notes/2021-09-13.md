## Getting Help in Jupyter


Python has a `print` function and we can use the help in jupyter to learn about
how to use it in different ways.

Given this code excerpt, how could you print out "Sarah_Brown"?

```{code-cell} ipython3
first = 'Sarah'
last = 'Brown'
```

We can use jupyter popup help wiht shift +tab or `?`
```
print?
```

Or the base python `help` function
```{code-cell} ipython3
help(print)
```

Notice that function can take multiple arguments and has a
keyword argument (must be used like `argument=value`) described as  `sep=' '`.
This means that by default it adds a space
```{code-cell} ipython3
print(first,last)
```

But we can change the separator.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["hide-input"]
print(first,last, sep='_')
# shift + tab for help
```

Note that it also defaults to end to use `\n`
```{code-cell} ipython3
print(first,last)
print('hello')
```

Where does this help information come from?  

````{margin}
```{note}
You can copy code from the notes, try hovering over this
```
````

```{code-cell} ipython3
def compute_grade(num_level1,num_level2,num_level3):
    '''
    Computes a grade for CSC/DSP310 from numbers of achievements at each level

    Parameters:
    ------------
    num_level1 : int
      number of level 1 achievements earned
    num_level2 : int
      number of level 2 achievements earned
    num_level3 : int
      number of level 3 achievements earned

    Returns:
    --------
    letter_grade : string
      letter grade with modifier (+/-)
    '''
    if num_level1 == 15:
        if num_level2 == 15:
            if num_level3 == 15:
                grade = 'A'
            elif num_level3 >= 10:
                grade = 'A-'
            elif num_level3 >=5:
                grade = 'B+'
            else:
                grade = 'B'
        elif num_level2 >=10:
            grade = 'B-'
        elif num_level2 >=5:
            grade = 'C+'
        else:
            grade = 'C'
    elif num_level1 >= 10:
        grade = 'C-'
    elif num_level1 >= 5:
        grade = 'D+'
    elif num_level1 >=3:
        grade = 'D'
    else:
        grade = 'F'


    return grade
```

We can apply `help` on the function we wrote

```{code-cell} ipython3
help(compute_grade)
```

It gets the docstring

## Everything is an Object in Python

we can use the builtin function `type` to inspect them, and get attributes with `.`

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(compute_grade)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
compute_grade.__name__
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
c = 4.5
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(c)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
c= 'hello'
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(c)
```

When do we use single vs double quotes?
- You can use either, unless you need to put one inside the string then use the
other.


```{code-cell} ipython3
my_sentence = "The professor's name is Dr. Brown"
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["raises-exception"]
my_sentence = 'The professor's name is Dr. Brown'
```

Yes we can escape special characters:
```{code-cell} ipython3
my_sentence = 'The professor\'s name is Dr. Brown'
```

but, it's less readable and not recommended.

## Good Code is always relative


In programming for data science, we are often trying to tell a story.  

```{admonition} Try it yourself
:class: tip
How might this goal change your code for this class relative to other code
you have written or could imagine writing?
```

Python is a fully [open source project](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/)
and as such is governed by [community](https://www.python.org/community/) [standards](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/) and [conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/).

```{admonition} Try it yourself
:class: tip
Find PEP8 (note that following it is part of earning python achievements)
```

The [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) for the full language is online too.


Guido van Rossum was the first main developer and wrote [essays](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/) about python too.


it's [pretty popular](https://www.python.org/about/quotes/)

## Coffee Data

We're going to use a dataset about [coffee quality](https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database/) today.

How was this dataset collected?
- reviewrs added to DB
- then scraped

Where did it come from?
- offee Quality Institute's trained reviewers.

what format is it provided in?
- csv (Comma Separated Values)

what other information is in this repository?
- the code to scrape
+++

Get raw url for the dataset click on the raw button on the [csv page](https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database/blob/master/data/robusta_ratings_raw.csv), then copy the url.
![a screenshot from github of the data file page with the raw button circled in pink](../img/gh_raw_file.png)

We'll save that url as a variable to work with it.
```{code-cell} ipython3
data_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database/master/data/robusta_data_cleaned.csv'
```

We will use a library called Pandas
```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
# import library and give it an alias (nickname) pd
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.read_csv(data_url)
```

```{admonition} Try it yourself
:class: tip

Read the data in again, but with the index correct and save it to a variable.
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["hide-input"]
coffee_df = pd.read_csv(data_url, index_col='Unnamed: 0')
```

Once we read it in, we van view the first 5 rows with the `head` method.
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.head()
```

```{important}
Remember to comment & annotate your code
```

## Follow Up questions

### General Questions

```{dropdown} How do you create code to scrape data from a website and compile it into a csv file?
We won't do too much of this in class, we'll rely mostly on data that's already
organized into a data file of some sort.

We will read directly from html tables though. To scrape data that's not
structured or only partially structured there are libraries for that.  
```

```{dropdown} Will we be using pandas a lot during the semester?

```

### Clarifying
```{dropdown} How do you auto finish your directories
in a terminal (and in jupyter and most code environments) you can use the tab
key to complete things.  We'll keep coming back to this.
```

```{dropdown} How do you properly shut down Jupyter Notebook
Shut down in the browser, close the tabs, then Ctrl+C in the terminal window.
```

```{dropdown} Is pd some sort of variable we set or was it built in?
pd is an alias that we set when we ran the line `import pandas as pd`

```

```{dropdown} How should I be organized for this class? Keep it all in a single folder? Keep it on GitHub?

I recommend keeping a folder for class ege CSC310 and then inside there create a
notes folder where you keep the Notebooks we generate in class each day and
clone the repository for each assignment in there.  Everyt assignment will have
a repo that will be on github, but your notes do not need to be in there.  

You'll only add specific things to your portfolio.  More infomation to follow

```

```{dropdown} I'm still not sure how to keep everything together in a portfolio for the semester?
Your portfolio will be carefully curated, not everything you do all semester.


```{dropdown} I have questions about the parts of the first assignment,
How the grading works is posted in the grading page now.  More information on
the github stuff to follow.
```

```{dropdown} I am still wondering if I am using anaconda or just normal terminal
on Windows: anaconda prompt for python things and GitBash for for git things
```

```{dropdown} Can I push this code into my portfolio using the anaconda terminal
Gti probably won't work on anaconda terminal.
```

### Grading Questions

```{dropdown} How do we keep track of which achievements we've earned?
They will get posted to Brightspace in the grade section. I'll notify you when
we post and make them visible and you should check that Brightspace matches what
we say on your code and e-mail if it doesn't.
```

```{dropdown} I don't really have many questions from today, but I was wondering if office hours were posted.
Not yet, still trying to find times, but I will post an announcement when they
are posted.
```

```{dropdown} Will we always submit homework through the portfolio folder in github?
It will always be on GitHub, but each assignment will have its own repository
```

```{dropdown} I'm just confused as how to view my feedback from the assignment
On your
```
### Questions we'll answer later this week

-  does each column have a number assigned to it in data frames?
- Can other data types be imported into a notebook and edited the same way as .csv files?

## Try it yourself

- How could you check if `pd` is built in or if we defined it?
- If we wanted to see more than 5 rows when printing the head of the dataset how would we do so?
