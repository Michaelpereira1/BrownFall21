# Welcome to Programming to Data Science

Today's goals:
1. Operate tools for in-class participation
1. Understand what Data Science is, in broad terms
1. Understand the syllabus (grading, topics covered, schedule, etc)
1. Understand how to learn in this course

## What is Data Science
In general:
![venn diagram of CS, Stats, & domain expertise with DS at the center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/rhodyds/main/img/ds_venn.png)

**statistics** is the type of math we use to make sense of data.
Formally, a statistic is just a function of data.

**computer science** is so that we can manipulate visualize and automate the inferences we make.

**domain expertise** helps us have the intuition to know if what we did worked
right. A statistic must be interpreted in context; the relevant context determines
what they mean and which are valid.  The context will say whether automating something
is safe or not, it can help us tell whether our code actually worked right or not.

For this class

We'll focus on the programming as our main means of studying data science, but we will
use bits of the other parts.  In particular, you're encouraged to choose datasets that you
have domain expertise about, or that you want to learn about.

But there are many definitions.  We'll use this one, but you may come across others.

### How does data science happen?

### how we'll cover it, in depth

![DS pipeline: collect, clean, explore, model, deploy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/rhodyds/main/img/process_course.png)

- *collect*: Discuss only a little; Minimal programming involved
- *clean*: Cover the main programming techniques; Some requires domain knowledge beyond scope of course
- *explore*: Cover the main programming techniques; Some requires domain knowledge beyond scope of course
- *model*:Cover the main programming, basic idea of models; How to use models, not how learning algorithms work
- *deploy*: A little bit at the end, but a lot of preparation for decision making around deployment


#### how we'll cover it in, time

![DS pipeline: collect, clean, explore, model, deploy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/rhodyds/main/img/process_course_time.png)

We'll cover exploratory data analysis before cleaning because those tools will help us check how we've cleaneed the data.


# How this class will work

- today is an exception
- in general we'll be live coding

Let's look at the [syllabus](https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall21/)

Read carefully to make sure you understand the grading; it's not typical points and an average.

Class is designed to avoid this:
