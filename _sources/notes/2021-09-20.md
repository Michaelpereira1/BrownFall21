```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# %load http://drsmb.co/310read

# share a sentence or a few words about how class is going or
# one takeaway you have from class so far. 
#  and attribute with a name affter a hyphen(-)
# You can remain anonymous (this page & the notes will be fully public)
# by attributing it to a celebrity or psuedonym, but include *some* sort of attribution
sentence_list = [
'Programming is a Practice. - Dr. Sarah Brown',
"So far it's going pretty good. - Matt",
'Pretty good pace, Github is still a little confusing is all - A',
"Class is going well, I'm really excited for the new skills that I will attain through this course. - Diondra",
'Good straight forward - Adam',
'Good pace and engaging - Jacob',
'I like cheese - Anon',
'Going well, I enjoy python - Aiden',
"Class is going very well, I'm excited to learn more about manipulating data sets - Greg",
'Really enjoying the class so far, Clear instructions and outcomes - Michael',
'So far this class is going well, very engaging lectures. - Anon',
'Great pace and notes have been really useful - Brandon',
'Good pace and easy to follow - Muhammad',
'Class is going well and engaging, but also a little difficult getting into the swing of things - Isaiah',
'Well paced, informative, and helpful - Vinnie',
'Spectacular -Michael Jackson',
'Very interesting! I am enjoying it a lot so far. Getting to experience pandas as well as using github/jupyter has been cool. One thing I would change though is slowing down the pace a bit. - Max'

```

Challenge: Create a DataFrame with
```
columns = ['sentence','attribution']
```

hints:

- use the DataFrame constructor
- use a list comprehension
- strings have a split method


when you have your DataFrame, paste the code for it on prismia. If you have questions,ask there or out loud.

```{code-cell} ipython3
[sent_attr.split('-') for sent_attr in sentence_list]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.DataFrame([sent_attr.split('-') for sent_attr in sentence_list],
            columns=['sentence','attribution'])
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
list_of_lists = [sent_attr.split('-') for sent_attr in sentence_list]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
list_of_lists[0]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
list_of_lists[0][1]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
len(sentence_list)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
len(list_of_lists)
```

# EDA

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_data_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database/master/data/robusta_data_cleaned.csv'
coffee_df = pd.read_csv(coffee_data_url)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.describe()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Balance'].describe()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
balance_sorted = coffee_df['Balance'].sort_values().values
balance_sorted[6]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Flavor'].quantile(.8)
```

Calculate the mean of the `Aftertaste` column:

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Aftertaste'].mean()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Color'].head()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Color'].value_counts()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.columns
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Country.of.Origin'].value_counts()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```
