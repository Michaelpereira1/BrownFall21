# Submission Introductions


Your portfolio will be assessed both on your demonstration of skills through your chapters that are inspired by the prompts and that your summary demonstrates that you *know* you learned the skills.


Each portfolio submission, you will edit the corresponding `submission_x_intro.md` file.  This is where you write your summary and reflect on your learning.  This reflection does not need to be long, it shouldn't take a very long time.  It's okay for it to be brief, mostly bullet points.

One part of your introduction is a **KWL** or **K**now, **W**ant to know, **L**earned, chart.  

In your file it will look like this:(but longer)
````
```{list-table} Portfolio 1 KWL Chart
:header-rows: 1
:name: kwl1

* - Skill
  - Know
  - Want to Know
  - Learned
* - python
  - basics
  - more efficient types
  -
* - access
  - that datasets are collated on kaggle
  - how to load data for analysis
  - how to load data from 3 different types and compare them
* - ...
  - ...
  - ...
  - ...
```
````

and when you build your portfolio it will render like this:

```{list-table} Portfolio 1 KWL Chart
